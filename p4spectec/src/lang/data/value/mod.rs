//! Values of IL and later stages, as arena handles and as trees
//!
//! `flat::Value` holds body, type, and span handles into one `Arena`.
//! `tree::Value` owns those contents and annotations.
//! Each representation defines its own `Value` and `ValueKind`.
//! `flat::ValueCase` pairs a mixop handle with its arguments;
//! `tree::ValueCase` owns its filled notation.
//! `flat::make` allocates values of each kind with their type,
//! `flat::get` projects a kind back out or fails with `ValueError`.
